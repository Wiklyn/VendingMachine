# VendingMachine

A prototype of a Vending Machine API. Currently, it includes basic functionalities such as registering products and orders in the database, retrieving the list of products and orders, fetching individual product and order details, updating product information, and deleting a product.
This README is also a prototype. But [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33143608/2sAYXFjdWa) you can find a simple documention I wrote on Postman.

NOTE: I haven't implemented tests yet. Also, I created the Infrastructure project for logging, but I haven't implemented it yet either.
